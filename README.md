ADVENTURE TIME
Introduction ðŸ‘€
A first-person maze-based adventure game with a captivating storyline about adventurers going on a world tour to amazing tourist attractions and landmarks across four continents with each location holding unforeseen dangers of their own waiting for the unsuspecting adventurers.

About The Game
There are two Modes to choose from:

Story Mode (Recommended)
Quick Play
There are 4 different locations within the game:

Katanga Nation
Baluba Kingdom
Kalakuta Republic
Mallam's Palace
Each of these choices births a story of its own and they all have their own different challenges in form of mazes for the player to solve.

The Quick Play mode also features a fifth location option- "Random" in case you're into surprises or you're feeling lucky.

The game also features a (not-so-)hidden treasure chest within every maze.

How To Play ðŸŽ®
Enter F, R, L, B or X (in uppercase) within the game to navigate Forward, Right, Left, go Back or Exit the maze, respectively.

A bird-eye view of the maze is displayed on the screen for the user. It serves as a satellite image (top elevation) of the maze and it is used for navigation within the maze.

Note: The satellite image does not display the appearance of the maze from what seems to be the Point-Of-View of the player, it is simply a zoom-out of the maze structure
